# Backlogs

### Login

### Sign-up

### Files Management

This is how files are organised in Markmind.

There are three main elements:

- **Workspace**

​	This is a workbook containing a set of collections.

- **Collection**

​	This is a workbook containing a set of resources.

- **Resource**

​	This is a markdown file.

```
Workspaces
├── Collection1
│   ├── Resource1.md
│   ├── Resource2.md
│   └── Resource3.md
├── Collection2
│   ├── Resource1.md
│   └── Resource2.md
└── Collection3
    ├── Resource1.md
    ├── Resource2.md
    ├── Resource3.md
    └── Resource4.md
```

For example, here we are a **Workspace** named Maths, three collections named **Algebra, Factorisation and Geometry**. Each of these contain resources like **exercises, homework** etc.

```
Maths
├── Algebra
│   ├── Ex_01.md
│   ├── Ex_02.md
│   ├── Ex_03.md
│   └── Ex_04.md
├── Factorisation
│   ├── Homework_1.md
│   ├── Homework_2.md
│   └── Homework_3.md
└── Geometry
    ├── Pythagore.md
    └── Thales.md
```



### Write text and directly convert to Markdown

The aim of Markmind is to make Markdown file editing accessible to all lamba users.  To achieve this, Markmind uses a versatile and interactive editor so that you can create blocks of different types without knowing the syntax of the language.

By simply typing "/", a list of proposed blocks will be displayed, allowing the user to choose the type of block they wish to create.

Here are the types of block we will have:

- Text
- To-do list
- Heading 1
- Heading 2
- Heading 3
- Table
- Bulleted list
- Numbered list
- Toggle list
- Quote
- Divider
- Callout
- Code

### Export resources to Markdown or PDF

Allows you to export a resource in Markdown or PDF format.

### Share Workspace, Collection and Resources (link)

This feature allows you to share access to a workspace, collection or resource so that another user can view or modify it.
