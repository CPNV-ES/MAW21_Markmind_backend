# MarkMind

This project is a Markdown editor, like Notion or Obsidian. It allows us to create Markdown files and quickly add elements without necessarily knowing the Markdown nomenclature.

It allows us to create Workspaces, containing folders to organise our notes and create documents in these folders.



## Backend

This repository contains the code for our Express.js-based backend.



## Technologies

Express JS (node)
